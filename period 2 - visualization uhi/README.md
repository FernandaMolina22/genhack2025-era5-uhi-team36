# 📊 Period 2 – UHI Visualization

This period focused on **visualizing the Urban Heat Island (UHI)** in *Reggio di Calabria*, using ERA5 and Sentinel NDVI products.  
We explored patterns, contrasts, and environmental signals behind summer heat peaks.

## 🌡️ Is ERA5 Reliable Enough?

Using nearby Messina stations as reference, we found:

- ERA5 reproduces **daily patterns very well** (correlation ≈ 0.9)  
  → useful for UHI visualization  
- But absolute values differ by **±1.5–2°C**  
  → representativeness uncertainty

ERA5 is therefore suitable for **patterns**, not exact temperatures.  
(As shown on slides 3–4.)

## 🛰️ NDVI & Summer Heat

The NDVI analysis (slides 5–6) showed:

- A **clear decrease in vegetation health** during recent summers  
- A **strong negative relationship** between NDVI and summer Tmax  
  → lower NDVI corresponds to hotter areas

This confirmed vegetation loss as a key driver of local heat intensification.

## ⭐ Key Takeaway

Period 2 demonstrated visually that:

- ERA5 can be used to map **UHI structure and contrasts**  
- NDVI provides a powerful **explanatory layer** for summer heat variability  
- Reggio Calabria shows **vegetation-driven heat amplification** during summer
