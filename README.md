# GenHack 2025 – ERA5 Urban Heat Island Bias Analysis & Explanatory Correction

This repository contains the complete work of **Group 36 – Codellera Andina** for the **GenHack 2025 Urban Heat Islands & Climate Downscaling Hackathon**.

The project explores the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in the Mediterranean, focusing on Central Italy (Toscana, Umbria, Lazio, and northern Campania) and develops a small, interpretable model to explain why **ERA5-Land** tends to show a **cold bias** compared to ground-station observations.

**Project duration:** Nov 13 – Dec 04, 2025  
**Challenge themes:** Urban Heat Islands, climate downscaling, and explanatory modelling

---

## 🚀 Objective

Our goal is to:

- Quantify **ERA5 Tmax bias** relative to ground stations  
- Understand how physical factors (vegetation, urbanization, distance to sea, wind, rainfall) influence this bias  
- Build a **simple regression model** to explain the bias  
- Communicate insights through visuals, metrics, and a clear narrative  

---

### 🗺️ Station Selection

We selected **12 stations** across Central Italy, evenly distributed across rural/urban and coastal/interior environments, to study how land cover and geography influence the ERA5 cold bias.

## 🧩 Repository Structure

The repository follows the four official hackathon periods:
```text
period1 - warmup exploration/     → Data exploration (ERA5, NDVI, stations)
period2 - visualization uhi/      → UHI visualization & communication
period3 - metrics bias analysis/  → Bias metrics + quantitative insight
period4 - modelling correction/   → Explanatory model (Linear/Ridge)
```

Each period folder contains:

- The **Jupyter notebooks**  
- The **slides** for that week  
- The **video** 
- A local **README.md** summarizing the period
